# Randomizer Map

This mod is made for the [Randomizer v2.0 mod, by seanpr96 and Firzen](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.RandomizerMod). Simply put, it adds a pin on the map for each randomized location. The pins will also show up differently if it's possible to get to that location with your current rando settings.

My hopes for this is to make learning the randomizer more accessible to newer players who don't know the base map as well, and to help more experienced players really learn the logic deeply and improve routing decisions.

Let me know if you find any bugs, have any feature requests, or just have questions.
